# Introduction

Welcome to my code base for my virtual assistant. A full guide on how to build your own will be available with this link **<--> INSERT LINK WHEN DONE <-->**

# Use Cases

> Setup your Virtual Assistant to open up all of your programs on command
> 
> Use it to open up any URL in a new browser
>
> Use it to store data or make reminders
>
> The list is almost endless

# General Idea

The general Idea here is that we will be taking our voices and turning it into lines of text. With this, we will be able to tell our program what to do based on what you said and what is within your own code. There are several things that you could possibly do, as long as you know how to code these things. For instance if you wanted your computer to take a screenshot whenever you tell it to.

# My goal

My goal here is to eventually take this bare bones code and create a fully customized program tailored to my needs, but also allow you to come and take the code and use it to your own needs. I will be making my code modular in practice so that the personal modules will not be pushed to github, but you can see and use any changes you've found.
